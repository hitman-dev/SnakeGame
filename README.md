Turtle is a Python library which used to create graphics, pictures, and games.
It was developed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Parpet and Cynthina Slolomon in 1967. It was a part of the original Logo programming language.
Turtle is a pre-installed library in Python that is similar to the virtual canvas that we can draw pictures and attractive shapes. 
It provides the onscreen pen that we can use for drawing.
